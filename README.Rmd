[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/stlData)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stlData)

The `stlData` package contains various datasets representing the City of St. Louis. These datasets are primary designed for teaching statistics, data science, and spatial data analysis using `R`.

## Installation

You can install `stlData` from [Github](https://github.com/chris-prener/stlData) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("chris-prener/stlData")
```

## Current Data
The package currently contains two data tables:

*   `stlAsmtha` - current asthma prevalence in 2014 by census tract via [Centers for Disease Control 500 Cities Project](https://www.cdc.gov/500cities/)
*   `stlInsurance` - lack of health insurance in 2014 by census tract  via [Centers for Disease Control 500 Cities Project](https://www.cdc.gov/500cities/)
*   `stlLead` - blood lead level test result data from 2010-2015 via [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/#interactive-lead) and 2015 5-year estimates for demographics (poverty and race) via the American Community Survey,  by census tract
*   `stlMurders` - all murders between 2008 and 2016 via the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department
*   `stlSmoking` - current smoking in 2014 by census tract  via [Centers for Disease Control 500 Cities Project](https://www.cdc.gov/500cities/)

## Useage
Once the package is loaded, the data contained in `stlData` can be assigned to data frames in your global environment and then explored. For example, to load the `stlAsthma` data:

```r
library("stlData")
asthma <- stlAsthma
str(asthma)
```

Additional examples and information are available in each table's help file. For example:

```r
?stlAsthma
```

## Future Data
I am currently working on a set of tables with educational outcomes by school for St. Louis City Public Schools. 

If you have data about the City or the metro area that you would like to donate or variables you'd like to see added to a table, open up an issue on the package's [GitHub page](http://github.com/chris-prener/stlData/issues).
